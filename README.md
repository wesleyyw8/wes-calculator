## My thoughts:

Given the time constraints, I put forth my best effort to complete the task within 8 hours. Given more time, I could have improved the appearance of my calculator. I also made a last-minute attempt to deploy it to Heroku, which resulted in a few additional commits. However, since the deadline has passed, I will not be updating this repository any further.  

 ## Assumptions: 

My assuptions are in the ASSUMPTIONS.md file  

# My project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 15.2.1.

## How to install it

Run `npm install` in oder to install the project's dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the website.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the angular tests
Watch out the trick to test a private function wihtout mocking the whole component and services etc because I like to start my code with the tests.
