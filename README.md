## My thoughts:

Since it is a time pressure task, I did the best I could to in less than 8 hours. If I could have more time I could make my calculator looks nicer.  
I took sometime to deploy the app to heroku. so you dont need to run the app locally if you dont want.  
 ## Assumptions: 

My assuptions are in the ASSUMPTIONS.md file  

# My project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 15.2.1.

## How to install it

Run `npm install` in oder to install the project's dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the website.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the angular tests
Watch out the trick to test a private function wihtout mocking the whole component and services etc because I like to start my code with the tests.
